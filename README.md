## üí• What's new in 2.0?
We're excited to announce a new major update to Cilicon! Here's a summary of what's new:
- While Cilicon 1.0 relied on a user-defined Login Item script in the VM, its new version now includes an SSH client and directly executes commands on the Guest OS
- Cilicon has partially adopted the [tart](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart) image format and can automatically convert 1.0 images to it
- The integrated OCI client can download pre-built CI images that have been created with/for tart. We recommend their [tart-ventura-xcode](https://github.com/cirruslabs/macos-image-templates/pkgs/container/macos-ventura-xcode) images.

## üîÅ About Cilicon

Cilicon is a macOS App that leverages Apple's [Virtualization Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization) to create, provision and run ephemeral virtual machines with minimal setup or maintenance effort. You should be able to get up and running with your self-hosted CI in minutes (not counting the initial image download).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚ú® Choosing a Source

Cilicon uses the `tart` container format and comes with an integrated OCI client to fetch images from the internet.

It's recommended to use the [publicly hosted images](https://github.com/cirruslabs/macos-image-templates/pkgs/container/macos-ventura-xcode), however you may create new images using one of the following:

- Using [tart](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart/) (supports downloading, installing, editing, and uploading to OCI) - recommended
- Using Cilicon Installer (supports downloading and installing. Editing can be done in Cilicon by enabling `editorMode`)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Cilicon expects a valid `cilicon.yml` file to be present in the Host OS's home directory.
For more information on available optional and required properties, see [Config.swift](/Cilicon/Config/Config.swift).

#### GitHub Actions

To use the GitHub Actions provisioner you will need to [create and install a new GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) with `Self-hosted runners` `Read & Write` permissions on the organization level and download the private key file to be referenced in the configuration file.

``` yml
source: oci://ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-ventura-xcode:14.2
provisioner:
  type: github
  config:
    appId: <APP_ID>
    organization: <ORGANIZATION_SLUG>
    privateKeyPath: ~/github.pem
```
#### Buildkite Agent

To use the Buildkite Agent provisioner, simply set your agent token in the provisioner config.

``` yml
source: oci://ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-ventura-xcode:14.2
provisioner:
  type: buildkite
  config:
    agentToken: <AGENT_TOKEN>
```

#### Script

If you want to run a script (e.g. to start a runner that's not natively supported), you may use the `script` provisioner.

``` yml
provisioner:
  type: script
  config:
     run: |
     	echo "Hello World"
        sleep 10
```

### üî® Setting Up the Host OS
It is recommended to use Cilicon on a macOS device fully dedicated to the task, ideally one that is [freshly restored](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-configurator-mac/apdd5f3c75ad/mac).

- Transfer `Cilicon.app`, `cilicon.yml` as well as any other files referenced by your config (e.g. Local image, GitHub private key etc.) to your Host OS.
- Add `Cilicon.app` as a launch item
- Set up automatic Login
- Disable automatic software updates
- Run `sudo pmset -b sleep 0; sudo pmset -b disablesleep 1` to disable sleep
- Disable any concept of battery savings, screen lock, wallpaper etc.

## üîÆ Ideas for the Future

### Support for more Provisioners
We use GitHub Actions for our iOS builds at [Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com) but would love to see Cilicon being used for other CI services as well.
Implementing support for more services should be easy by building on top of the `Provisioner` protocol.

### Monitoring
A logging or monitoring concept would greatly improve identifying and troubleshooting any potential issues and provide the ability to notify the team in real time.
