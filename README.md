<details><summary><h3>üí• What's new in 2.0?</h3></summary>
We're excited to announce a new major update to Cilicon! Here's a summary of what's new:
<ul>
        <li>While Cilicon 1.0 relied on a user-defined Login Item script in the VM, its new version now includes an SSH client and directly executes commands on the VM.</li>
        <li>Cilicon has partially adopted the <a href="https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart">tart</a> image format and can automatically convert 1.0 images to it.</li>
        <li>The integrated OCI client can download pre-built CI images that have been created with/for tart. We recommend their <a href="https://github.com/cirruslabs/macos-image-templates/pkgs/container/macos-sonoma-xcode">macos-sonoma-xcode</a> images.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Migrating from 1.0</h4>
<ul>
        <li>The config file schema has changed slightly. In most cases renaming the <code>vmBundlePath</code> property to <code>source</code> should suffice.</li>
        <li>When Cilicon detects a 1.0 image it will offer you to automatically convert it to the new format for you.</li>
	<li>When converting an image from the 1.0 format, you must enable SSH and set the respective credentials in the config (or use the default <code>admin:admin</code>).</li>
</ul>
</details>

## üîÅ About Cilicon

Cilicon is a macOS App that leverages Apple's [Virtualization Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization) to create, provision and run ephemeral CI VMs with near-native performance. It currently supports Github Actions, Buildkite Agent, GitLab Runner and arbitrary scripts. Depending on your setup, should be able to get up and running with your self-hosted CI in minutes üöÄ

Cilicon operates in a very simple cycle described below:

</table>

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started, download the latest release [here](https://github.com/traderepublic/Cilicon/releases/latest).

### ‚ú® Choosing a Source

Cilicon uses the `tart` container format and comes with an integrated [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) client to fetch images from the internet.

It's recommended to use [publicly hosted images](https://github.com/cirruslabs/macos-image-templates/pkgs/container/macos-sonoma-xcode), however if you need to create or customize your own image, you may use [tart](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart/).


#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
- When choosing an OCI hosted image, make sure to prepend the `oci://` scheme to the url. Cilicon will otherwise assume a local filesystem path.
- Don't use the `latest` tag when choosing an image version. Instead pick the specific version of Xcode you would like to have installed (e.g. `14.3`).
- Images downloaded via OCI will reside in the `~/.tart` folder which should be cleared of unused images periodically.
- Images with newer versions of macOS may be published with the same version of Xcode installed. In case you want to upgrade, you may need to manually delete the outdated image and start Cilicon again.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Cilicon expects a `cilicon.yml` file to be present in the Host OS's home directory.
For more information on all available settings see [Config.swift](/Cilicon/Config/Config.swift).

#### GitHub Actions

To use the GitHub Actions provisioner you will need to [create and install a new GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) with `Self-hosted runners` `Read & Write` permissions on the organization level and download the private key file to be referenced in the configuration file.

``` yml
source: oci://ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-runner:sequoia
provisioner:
  type: github
  config:
    appId: <APP_ID>
    organization: <ORGANIZATION_SLUG>
    privateKeyPath: ~/github.pem
```
#### GitLab Runner

To use the GitLab Runner provisioner you will need to [create a runner with an authentication token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html#create-a-shared-runner-with-an-authentication-token).

Minimal example:

``` yml
source: oci://ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-runner:sequoia
provisioner:
  type: gitlab
  config:
    gitlabURL: <GITLAB_INSTANCE_URL>
    runnerToken: <RUNNER_TOKEN>
```

Full configuration:

``` yml
source: oci://ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-runner:sequoia
provisioner:
  type: gitlab
  config:
    gitlabURL: <GITLAB_INSTANCE_URL>
    runnerToken: <RUNNER_TOKEN>
    executor: <EXECUTOR> # defaults to 'shell'
    maxNumberOfBuilds: <MAX_BUILDS> # defaults to '1'
    downloadLatest: <DOWNLOAD_LATEST> # defaults to 'true'. If 'false' it expects the binary to be present at the user's home directory
    downloadURL: <DOWNLOAD_URL> # defaults to GitLab official S3 bucket
    tomlPath: <PATH_TO_TOML> # defaults to `nil`. If set, it ignores the other runner related variables and passes the specified path to the runner executable
consoleDevices:
  - tart-version-cilicon
```

#### Buildkite Agent

To use the Buildkite Agent provisioner, simply set your agent token in the provisioner config.

``` yml
source: oci://ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-runner:sequoia
provisioner:
  type: buildkite
  config:
    agentToken: <AGENT_TOKEN>
```

#### Script

If you want to run a script (e.g. to start a runner that's not natively supported), you may use the `script` provisioner.

``` yml
source: oci://ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-runner:sequoia
provisioner:
  type: script
  config:
     run: |
     	echo "Hello World"
        sleep 10
```

#### Console Devices

Cilicon supports injecting console devices into the VM configuration. This is particularly useful for compatibility with tools like [tart-guest-agent](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart-guest-agent) which expect specific console devices to be present.

To add console devices, use the `consoleDevices` field in your configuration:

```yml
consoleDevices:
  - tart-version-cilicon
```

### üî® Setting Up the Host OS
It is recommended to use Cilicon on a macOS device fully dedicated to the task, ideally one that is [freshly restored](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-configurator-mac/apdd5f3c75ad/mac).

If you don't want to host your machine locally, [OakHost](https://www.oakhost.net/) provides great value dedicated Macs and are kindly offering 10% off the first two months for new customers with the code `CILICON10` (Disclaimer: We do not receive any form of compensation from sharing this code).

- Transfer `Cilicon.app`, `cilicon.yml` as well as any other files referenced by your config (e.g. Local image, GitHub private key etc.) to your Host OS.
- Add `Cilicon.app` as a launch item
- Set up Automatic Login
- Disable automatic software updates
- Disable any concept of screen lock, battery saving etc.


## üîÆ Ideas for the Future

### Support for more Provisioners
We use GitHub Actions for our iOS builds at [Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com) but would love to see Cilicon being used for other CI services as well.
Implementing support for more services should be easy by building on top of the `Provisioner` protocol.

### Running 2 VMs in parallel
Xcode builds often don't use all of the compute resources available. Therefore running 2 VMs im parallel (more are not possible due to a limitation of the Virtualization framework) would be a welcome addition.

### Monitoring
A logging or monitoring concept would greatly improve identifying and troubleshooting any potential issues and provide the ability to notify the team in real time.
