## üí• What's new in 2.0?
We're excited to announce a new major update to Cilicon! Here's a summary of what's new:
- While Cilicon 1.0 relied on a user-defined Login Item in the VM, its new version now includes an SSH client and directly executes commands on the Guest OS
- Cilicon has partially adopted the [tart](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart) image format and allows converting 1.0 images to it
- The integrated OCI client can download pre-built CI VMs that have been created with/for tart. We recommend their [tart-ventura-xcode](https://github.com/cirruslabs/macos-image-templates/pkgs/container/macos-ventura-xcode) images.

## üîÅ About Cilicon

Cilicon is a macOS App that leverages Apple's [Virtualization Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization) to create, provision and run ephemeral virtual machines with minimal setup or maintenance effort. You should be able to get up and running with your self-hosted CI in less than an hour.

Cilicon is based on the following simple cycle.

<p align="center">

</br><i>The Cilicon Cycle</i>
</p>

### Duplicate Image

Cilicon creates a clone of your Virtual Machine bundle for each run. [APFS clones](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/file_system/about_apple_file_system) make this task extremely fast, even with large bundles.

### Start and connect via SSH

Cilcion starts the VM, detects its DHCP lease address and connects via SSH using the provided credentials.

### Run provisioning commands

Cilicon comes with several provisioners out of the box:

- Github Actions
- GitLab Runner
- Buildkite Agent
- Script

### Stop and remove the VM
Cilicon stops and removes the VM as soon as the last command exits. After removing the "spent" image, it starts over.

</p>

## üöÄ Getting Started
Currently Cilicon offers native support for GitHub Actions and Gitlab Runner on self-hosted instances. It also offers a "Script" provisioner which allows running any type of command.

The host as well as the guest system must be running macOS 13 or newer and, as the name implies, Cilicon only runs on Apple Silicon.

To get started download Cilicon and Cilicon Installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/traderepublic/Cilicon/releases/latest).

<details>
  <summary>üìñ Terminology</summary> 
  <ul>
  	<li><code>Host OS</code> is the OS that runs the Cilicon App</li>
  	<li><code>Guest OS</code> is the Virtual Machine running through Cilicon</li>
  </ul>
</details>

### ‚ú® Choosing a Source

Cilicon uses the `tart` container format and comes with an integrated OCI client.
It's recommended to use the [publically hosted images](https://github.com/cirruslabs/macos-image-templates/pkgs/container/macos-ventura-xcode) 
There are two ways to create images for Cilicon:

- Using [tart](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart/) (supports downloading, installing, editing, and uploading to OCI) - recommended
- Using Cilicon Installer (supports downloading and installing. Editing can be done in Cilicon by enabling `editorMode`)

</p>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Cilicon expects a valid `cilicon.yml` file to be present in the Host OS's home directory.

#### GitHub Actions

To use the GitHub Actions provisioner you will need to [create and install a new GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) with `Self-hosted runners` `Read & Write` permissions on the organization level and download the private key file to be referenced in the configuration file.

``` yml
source: oci://ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-ventura-xcode:14.2
provisioner:
  type: github
  config:
    appId: 123456
    organization: traderepublic
    privateKeyPath: ~/github.pem
```

For more information on available optional and required properties, see [Config.swift](/Cilicon/Config/Config.swift).

#### GitLab Runner

To use the GitLab Runner provisioner, download the GitLab Runner binary `gitlab-runner-darwin-arm64` from the GitLab Runner Releases page and place it in the VM Bundle's `Resources` folder so that it can be accessed by the VM.

Configure the `cilicon.yml` file with the correct values:

``` yml
provisioner:
  type: gitlab
  config:
     name: "my-runner"
     url: "https://gitlab.yourcompany.net/"
     registrationToken: "your-runner-registration-token"
     tagList: "some-tags,comma-separated"
```

### üîß Setting up the Guest OS
Once you have created a new VM Bundle you will need to set it up. To do so, enable the `editorMode` in the `cilicon.yml` file.
This will disable bundle duplication, provisioning and automatic restarting after shutdown.

It will also mount the bundle's `Editor Resources` folder to `/Volumes/My Shared Files/Resources`, which is the same path that `Resources` will be mounted to outside of editor mode. You can use this to provide any dependencies like installers to your Guest OS during setup.
After clicking through the macOS setup screens you can set up your Guest OS:
- Enable automatic login
- Disable Automatic Software updates
- Disable any concept of screen locking or power saving
- Select the dummy `start.command` file as a launch item which will start the CI agent/runner when mounted to the actual `Resources` folder.
- Install any dependencies you may need, such as Xcode, Command line tools, brew, etc.

<details>
  <summary>Depending on your setup, you may also want to enable passwordless <code>sudo</code>.</summary> 

Enter visudo:

```
sudo visudo
```

Find the admin group permission section:
```
%admin          ALL = (ALL) ALL
```
	
Change to add `NOPASSWD:`:
```
%admin          ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
</details>

Once you've set up your Guest OS, close all applications and shut down the Guest OS.

You can always edit your bundle further using editor mode.

Once you have configured your Guest OS, you will need provision your `Resources` folder with a `start.command` script to be run outside of editor mode.
You can find examples in [VM Resources](/VM%20Resources).

### üî® Setting Up the Host OS
It is recommended to use Cilicon on a macOS device fully dedicated to the task, ideally one that is [freshly restored](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-configurator-mac/apdd5f3c75ad/mac).

- Transfer `Cilicon.app`, `VM.bundle`, `cilicon.yml` as well as any other files referenced by your config (e.g. Github private key) to your Host OS.
- Add `Cilicon.app` as a launch item
- Set up automatic Login
- Disable automatic software updates
- Run `sudo pmset -b sleep 0; sudo pmset -b disablesleep 1` to disable sleep
- Disable any concept of battery savings, screen lock, wallpaper etc.

## üßë‚Äçüîß Maintenance
Cilicon strives to keep maintenance effort at a minimum with features like automatic system restarts and provisioning from external disks.

### Automatic Host OS Restart

Cilicon supports restarting the Host OS after a set number of runs.

To enable this, simply set the `numberOfRunsUntilHostReboot` property in your `cilicon.yml` file.

If you're using this feature you may want to consider disabling the macOS boot chime ("Play sound on startup" in system settings)

### Image provisioning via external drive
Cilicon supports interactionless copying of VM images from external drives to the Host OS. This feature can be enabled by setting the `autoTransferImageVolume` in your `cilicon.yml` file. The bundle must be on the root of the drive and named `VM.bundle`.

The Host machine will notify start and finish of the process by playing system sounds and unmount the volume after copying is complete.
The new image will be be used after the next run.

If the Guest VM is shut down while Cilicon is copying a bundle, it will wait for it to complete copying before restarting the image.

Due to the new Accessory Security features in Ventura, macOS will require explicit consent for USB drives to be mounted and for Cilicon to access the drive. Once you have accepted these prompts for the first time, you should be able to run the process without any interaction on the device.

## üîÆ Ideas for the Future

### Support for more Provisioners
We use GitHub Actions for our iOS builds at [Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com) but would love to see Cilicon being used for other CI services as well.
Implementing support for more services should be easy by building on top of the `Provisioner` protocol.

### Automated Bundle provisioning over the network
Updating an image on your Host machines is simple and depending on your image size and transfer medium it's also relatively fast.
In the future Cilicon could automatically fetch new images from a defined server on the local network.

### Monitoring
A logging or monitoring concept would greatly improve identifying and troubleshooting any potential issues and provide the ability to notify the team in real time.

### Setup Scripts
A lot of the setup of both Host and Guest OS can be scripted. Providing scripts for common setups would greatly increase the time to get started with Cilicon.
